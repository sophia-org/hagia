# Port Provenance

Hagia is a standalone port, not a Git-history fork. This preserves Triad as a
River window manager and lets Hagia review each feature against Sophia's
stricter authority boundary.

The initial policy port uses the local Triad baseline:

```

The first slice carries forward design concepts rather than source files:

- typed logical window, view, output, and tag identities;
- nonzero tag masks and tag-intersection visibility;
- ordered stable entities independent of compositor handles;
- centralized state mutation and pure layout projection; and
- output-loss migration as an explicit state transition.

No River/Wayland adapter, generated protocol module, configuration parser,
shell implementation, metadata rule, or Triad project history is imported.
Future source-level ports must retain the applicable Triad MIT notice and name
the source files and baseline here.
